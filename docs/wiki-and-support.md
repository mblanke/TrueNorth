# Wiki and Support (trouble tickets)

A Confluence-style wiki and Jira-style ticketing, built into TrueNorth so they share
sign-in, tenants and roles, and tickets can point at a range or exercise.

Approved mockup: `docs/mockups/wiki-tickets.html` (PNGs in `docs/mockups/wiki-tickets-png/`).

## Where the code is

| Part | Path |
|---|---|
| Models | `control-plane/api/app/models_wiki.py`, `models_tickets.py` (registered for Alembic by `app/sections.py`) |
| Migration | `control-plane/api/alembic/versions/a8b9c0d1e2f3_add_wiki_and_tickets.py` |
| API | `control-plane/api/app/routers/wiki.py` (`/wiki`), `routers/tickets.py` (`/tickets`); schemas inline |
| Permissions | `WIKI_READ/EDIT/ADMIN`, `TICKET_CREATE/WORK/ADMIN` in `app/rbac.py` |
| API clients | `core/services/wiki-api.service.ts`, `tickets-api.service.ts`; types alias `core/api/schema.d.ts` (ADR 0002) |
| Screens | `control-plane/web/src/app/features/wiki/`, `features/tickets/` (routes `/wiki`, `/support`) |
| Shared UI | `shared/markdown/` (marked + DOMPurify), `shared/kb-styles.component.ts`, `shared/kb-roles.ts` |
| Tests | `tests/api/test_wiki.py`, `test_wiki_concurrency.py`, `test_tickets.py`, `*.spec.ts` |

## Who can do what

| | Student / Observer | Instructor / Range ops | Admin |
|---|---|---|---|
| Read wiki spaces marked "everyone" | yes | yes | yes |
| Read "staff only" spaces, drafts | no (404) | yes | yes |
| Write and edit pages; see and restore history | no | yes | yes |
| Create / archive spaces | no | no | yes |
| File tickets | student: yes; observer: no (Support explains this) | yes | yes |
| See tickets | only their own | everyone's in the tenant | everyone's |
| Internal notes | never see them | read and write | read and write |
| Triage, assign, the board | no | yes | yes |
| Queues, delete tickets | no | no | yes |

A reporter can edit their ticket's subject and description, close it once resolved, and
reopen it. Their reply to a "Waiting on reporter" ticket moves it back to Open.

## Behaviour worth knowing

- **Edit conflicts.** A page save carries the revision it started from and is a
  compare-and-set in the database. If someone saved in between, the API answers 409 with
  their version; the editor keeps your text and lets you keep yours (theirs stays in
  History) or load theirs. Every real change advances the revision, including publishing,
  unpublishing, tags and moves, so a stale save cannot quietly undo any of them.
- **History is never rewritten.** Restoring an old revision creates a new one, and also
  names the revision it was decided against. History is editors-only: old revisions can
  predate publication (an unpublished draft holding an answer key).
- **Deleting a page** soft-deletes everything under it; archiving a space hides it.
- **Ticket numbers** (`TN-n`) are per tenant; on Postgres an advisory lock queues
  concurrent filings (a class reporting the same outage) instead of letting them collide. Every change to status, priority, type,
  assignee, queue or subject, and every attachment, is recorded in the ticket's history.
- **Attachments** are stored in MinIO bucket `tickets`, 25 MB each, and are always
  downloaded as files (`application/octet-stream`, UTF-8 filenames), never rendered in the
  browser. Internal notes never change what the reporter sees, including "last updated".
- **Queues.** The last queue can't be deleted; a deleted queue's slug can be reused.
- **Board.** New tickets get distinct positions so drag-reordering sticks; the closed
  column shows the 50 most recent.
- **Markdown** from users is sanitised with DOMPurify before display: no scripts, event
  handlers, `javascript:` links, iframes, forms, or `style`/`class`/`id` attributes, and
  rendered text cannot draw outside its box.
- **"Report a problem"** appears on the Exercises list, the exercise page and the Ranges
  list, and opens `/support/new` with the range/exercise filled in.

## Reviews

Security and adversarial reviews ran on 2026-10-05. Every confirmed finding was fixed
with a regression test. Two were deliberately left alone: a student can link a ticket to
any range in their tenant, as they can already list them all through `GET /ranges`; and a
NaN in any JSON float field makes FastAPI's 422 response itself fail with a 500, which is
an app-wide issue outside this section.

## Not in this version

- Notifications. TrueNorth has no persistent in-app notification store yet (the
  `notifications` service keeps them in memory, and no router uses it). Staff use the
  "Assigned to me" tab.
- AI triage ("ask AI", "run diagnostics") from the March design.
- Images inside wiki pages, and full-text search through OpenSearch (search is
  title/body/tags matching in the database today).
